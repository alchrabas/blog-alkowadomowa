It's advised to run these scripts in the virtual environment:

python3 -m venv .venv
. ./.venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Next it's possible to run:

python3 plot_brzoskwiniowka.py

and

python3 plot_brzoskwiniowka.py

to both display the graphs in the interactive mode and save them in the current directory.
